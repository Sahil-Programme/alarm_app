# Clock App

A flutter clock and alarm app based on an idea from [@Kalpesh Prithyani](linkedin.com/in/kalpesh-prithyani) which can be found [here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7hjhyApgav/)

## Current Progress

Currently I have the prototype for one of the app's page i.e. the page to add alarms. The major challenge on this page was to add the neumorphic shadows as can be seen in the image

## To do:

-> Still need to make the app functional.

-> Save the alarms.

-> Add backgound services.

### Major update

-> Add spotify services for alarm tones.

-> Add other pages.

-> Add morning news feed section.

-> Add notifications and foreground view when not active.
